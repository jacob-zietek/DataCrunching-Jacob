Mess with SMILES strings

In our set up the compounds are specified by SMILES strings.
We echo these SMILES strings to OpenBabel to convert them to
3D structures. However, the SMILES can be severely problematic,
typically when there are multiple non-bonded fragments. Examples
are (all of which are actual approved drugs):

- Cc1ccccn1.N.[Cl-].[Cl-].[Pt+2] (DB-4455)
- S1SSSSSSS1.[99Tc] (DB-7523)
- ClCC1CO1.NCC=C (DB-546)
- Nc1ccc2c(c1)[n+](C)c1c(c2)ccc(c1)N.[Cl-] (DB-9274)
- N[C@H](C(=O)O)CS.[O-]C(=O)[C@H](C[S-])N.NCC(=O)O.[Fe+2] (DB-7645)
- OC(=O)CCc1ccc(c(c1)/N=C/c1ccccc1[O-])/N=C/c1ccccc1[O-].[Fe+4] (DB-4391)

Looking at these examples there different categories of compounds that
are relevant to the task in hand.

Some case are simple, such as DB-9274,
which is an organic ion with a trivial Chlorine ion as a counter ion. 
One can safely assume that the Chlorine is irrelevant for the 
therapeutic effect. Hence we can throw that ion away leaving us with a 
fully connected fragment. 

The other cases are much more complicated. Is DB-546 an active complex
or is one of the 2 fragments an unimportant ion? DB-4455, DB-7523, and
DB-4391 are almost certainly complexes where the metal ion has to be
in a very specific location, but this position is not encoded in the
SMILES string. DB-7645 is even worse with multiple organic fragments and
a metal ion. Clearly the metal ion has to be complexed somewhere and
at the same time non of the organic fragments look like trivial ions. 

To deal with this mess we take a simple approach:

1. Split the SMILES string at "."
2. Delete all trivial ions (K, Na, Cl, K+, Na+, Cl-, OH-, etc.)
3. If only 1 fragment remains echo it to standard output, else the situation is too complicated and we abort.
